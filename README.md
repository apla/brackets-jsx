React (.jsx) language mode for Brackets IDE
=========================================

Actually this is just backported [jsx mode](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/mode/jsx/jsx.js) for CodeMirror.

A word to the [marijnh](https://github.com/marijnh):

> Well, I suppose if three people are working on one, the need for this mode is pressing.
> And it looks like it's going to be less work to write one myself rather than to keep hinting
> and reviewing and pushing people in the right direction. You can find my version in b3f9487.
> Please test it and submit failing test cases. If this helps you in a financial way,
> a donation to cover the morning spent on this is much appreciated.
